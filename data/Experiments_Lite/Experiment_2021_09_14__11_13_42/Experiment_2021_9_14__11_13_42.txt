This Experiment setup is identical to 
D:\_GC_DataSetBuilder\DBItems\gc_0_4_7_prod_gcmp\Experiments\Experiment_2021_9_3__13_44_16
which was not pre-heated
This current experiment is pre-heated


Everytime CN com has reported an error, that needed to restart the CN com, a new CN file has been created

No problems during these depositions:

Following depositions had multiple CN com errors

Remark: 
CNCom File name reports a time stamp which is slightly different from the milliseconds content of its first item (some seconds after the first item),
since recording is performed online, while persistence is performed on internal DSB demand (buffer is full), and occurs later
